python-hawkey Reference Manual
******************************

Introduction
============

This reference manual describes Python API to the library. For a quick start
take a look at :doc:`tutorial-py`. To be sure that you are familiar with our
deprecation policy, see :doc:`changes`.

.. NOTE::

  The API consists of exactly those elements described in this document, items
  not documented here can change from release to release. Opening a `bugzilla`_
  if certain needed functionality is not exposed is the right thing to do.

.. WARNING::

  The manual is not complete yet - the features are being added incrementally
  these days.
